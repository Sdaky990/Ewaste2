    <h2>Understanding E-Waste</h2>
	
    <p>
      Electronic waste or E-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. It includes everything from old computers and mobile phones to household appliances and medical equipments.
      As technology rapidly evolves, more devices are being thrown away, often improperly. The problem with e-waste is that it contains hazardous materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can harm human health and the environment if not disposed of properly. At the same time,
	  e-waste also holds valuable resources like copper, gold, and silver, making proper recycling essential.
      
	  Globally, e-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams, with millions of tonnes generated each year. Unfortunately, less than a quarter of it is formally recycled, leading to significant environmental and health risks.

    <p>
     This website is dedicated to educating the community about E-waste, its environmental and health risks, and proper disposal methods. The goal is to promote responsible recycling and encourage sustainable habits to reduce e-waste pollution.
